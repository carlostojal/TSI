In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), as in any other programming paradigm, before jumping to the keyboard there
are many things you have to plan.
In object oriented programming the code is organized in objects. This requires a different approach.

First you will need to know what will you need your program to do, and what is involved in it.
For example, in a school system, you will probably need to manage students.
So you can convert that from real life to objects.

For example, every student has a name, process number, year, course and subjects. These would be the student object attributes.
You have to do this for everything that you will need to manage in your program.
Then, you only have to create other classes and methods that will manage and connect all the objects. In this case, probably
methods to add, remove or update students' information would be useful.
